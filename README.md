Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of
enemies controlled by the computer.

---

For the first assignment we refactored the classes in the character package, then we changed
the herarchy for the weapon classes, and we created a class for every type of weapon in the game 
(enum class was deleted for not following the open-closed letter in SOLID).

We fixed the toString() method for every player character class, and we test our classes by creating
objects on the Main.kt file.

**For now the only way of using this project is to run the Main.kt script and check the print of the
objects that we created.**

There is also a UML diagram on UML directory.
